# 🍕 AI-Powered Food Image Calorie Estimator

This is a beginner-friendly AI project that predicts the type of food in an uploaded image and estimates its calorie content using a custom dataset.

Built with 💻 Python, 🧠 MobileNetV2 (Pretrained Model), and 🔢 Pandas — it's my very first step into real-world AI applications.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload any food image (pizza, burger, noodles, etc.)
- Get top 3 food predictions using a pretrained MobileNetV2 model
- Automatically estimates calories based on a custom calories.csv file

---

## 📊 How It Works
1. The image is uploaded and resized to 224x224
2. MobileNetV2 processes the image and predicts food labels
3. The top prediction is matched against a calorie dataset
4. Output: Top food guesses + Estimated Calories 🔥

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Pandas & Numpy
- Pretrained MobileNetV2 (from ImageNet)

---

## 📁 Files in This Project
- food_calorie_estimator.ipynb – Colab Notebook with all code
- calories.csv – Custom food-to-calorie dataset
- README.md – Project description

---

## 💡 Future Ideas
- Use a custom-trained food classifier
- Turn it into a web or mobile app
- Add support for multiple food items in one image
- Connect to a real-time nutrition API for accuracy

---

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Open food_calorie_estimator.ipynb in Google Colab  
2. Run all cells (Shift + Enter or Runtime > Run all)  
3. Upload any food image when prompted  
4. See the top 3 predictions and estimated calories!

## ⚠️ Limitations

- The current model (MobileNetV2) is pre-trained on the *ImageNet* dataset, which contains general object classes, not specifically food.
- As a result, the model may misclassify certain foods (e.g., predicting "eggnog" instead of "rice bowl").
- Calorie information is matched based on the model's top prediction and may not always reflect the actual food.
- A future version of this project may use a *food-specific model* like one trained on the *Food-101* dataset to improve accuracy and prediction quality.
