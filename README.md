# 🍕 AI-Powered Food Image Calorie Estimator

This is a beginner-friendly AI project that predicts the type of food in an uploaded image and estimates its calorie content using a custom dataset.

Built with 💻 Python, 🧠 MobileNetV2 (Pretrained Model), and 🔢 Pandas — it's my very first step into real-world AI applications.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload any food image (pizza, burger, noodles, etc.)
- Get top 3 food predictions using a pretrained MobileNetV2 model
- Automatically estimates calories based on a custom calories.csv file

---

## 📊 How It Works
1. The image is uploaded and resized to 224x224
2. MobileNetV2 processes the image and predicts food labels
3. The top prediction is matched against a calorie dataset
4. Output: Top food guesses + Estimated Calories 🔥

## 💡 Future Ideas
- Use a custom-trained food classifier
- Turn it into a web or mobile app
- Add support for multiple food items in one image
- Connect to a real-time nutrition API for accuracy
